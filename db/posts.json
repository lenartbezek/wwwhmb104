{"_id":{"$oid":"5dee4824f0432e2350464ed1"},"title":"The Terminator","content":"I have a morning ritual that I need to share. I call it \"the terminator\". First I crouch down in the shower in the classic \"naked terminator traveling through time\" pose. With my eyes closed I crouch there for a minute, visualizing either Arnold or the guy from the second movie (not the chick in the third one because that one sucked) and I start to hum the terminator theme. Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless, cyborg badass. The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It ruins the fantasy.","postedBy":{"$oid":"5dee4520f0432e2350464ecd"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5dee4871f0432e2350464ed3"},"title":"M\u0026M competition","content":"Whenever I get a package of plain M\u0026Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M\u0026M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M\u0026Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M\u0026Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M\u0026M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M\u0026M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M\u0026M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M\u0026Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.","postedBy":{"$oid":"5dee4520f0432e2350464ecd"}}
